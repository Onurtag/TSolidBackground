# **TSolidBackground**  
------------------  

TSolidBackground allows you to immerse in a window completely by creating a solid background and hiding window borders.  
Reading Visual Novels was why I created this but it can also be used in a lot more ways. (Well I put in a lot of extra features after all)  


    Default Hotkeys (can be changed in .ini):  
    Shift+T: TSolidBackground key
    Shift+Y: Make window always on top  
    Shift+G: Center Window  
    Shift+F: Show/Hide taskbar
    F8: Suspend Hotkeys  
    Shift+O: Options  
    Default Color: 250000

##[Download latest .exe here](https://bitbucket.org/Onurtag/tsolidbackground/downloads)  
**Current version: v2 (29.03.15)**  

Compiled using the latest Ahk2Exe  

--------------------  
## Things To Know  

* You have to select the window before using most hotkeys.  

* You can change the background color using the Shift+O option window.  

* TSolidBackground.ini file will be created when you use the options key (you don't have to enter an input).  
    After creating the .ini file you can open it using a text editor to change the hotkeys.  
    [HOTKEY EDITING GUIDE](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm)  

* If you never use the options key it will never create the .ini file so you can just carry around the .exe (or the ahk)  

* Exiting using the notification icon (right click - exit) will fix your windows if you left them in "Always On Top" mode.  
    
* Always On Top mode can be used for multiple windows at the same time  

* [Also this exists for some.](http://i.imgur.com/DbSYoZC.png) You might not need to use TSolidBackground if this works for you. (Thanks demeteloaf)

--------------------  
**Known Bugs:**  

* Background sometimes goes over the selected window.  
-This is fixed but it might still happen on VERY slow computers or if you don't select the window before using the hotkey.  


* Explorer.exe might freeze and restart if you spam the hotkeys too much.  


If you have any problems, let me know. I'll try to fix it.
