# **TSolidBackground**  
------------------  

TSolidBackground allows you to immerse in a window completely by creating a solid background and hiding window borders.  
Reading Visual Novels was why I created this but it can also be used in a lot more ways. (Well I put in a lot of extra features after all)  


    Default Hotkeys (can be changed in .ini):  
    Shift+T: TSolidBackground key
    Shift+Y: Make window always on top  
    Shift+G: Center Window  
    Shift+F: Show/Hide taskbar
    F8: Suspend Hotkeys  
    Shift+O: Options  
    Default Color: 250000

##[Download latest .exe here](https://bitbucket.org/Onurtag/tsolidbackground/downloads)  
**Current version: v2.1 (29.03.15)**  

Compiled using the latest Ahk2Exe  

--------------------  
## Things To Know  

* You have to select the window before using most hotkeys.  

* You can change the background color using the Shift+O option window.  

* TSolidBackground.ini file will be created when you use the options key (you don't have to enter an input).  
    After creating the .ini file you can open it using a text editor to change the hotkeys.  
    [HOTKEY EDITING GUIDE](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm)  

* If you never use the options key it will never create the .ini file so you can just carry around the .exe (or the ahk)  

* Exiting using the notification icon (right click - exit) will fix your windows if you left them in "Always On Top" mode.  
    
* Always On Top mode can be used for multiple windows at the same time  

* [Also this exists for some.](http://i.imgur.com/DbSYoZC.png) You might not need to use TSolidBackground if this works for you. (Thanks demeteloaf)

--------------------  
**Known Bugs:**  

* TSolidBackground will disable Always On Top if the selected window is Always On Top.  
You can use the Always On Top hotkey afterwards if you really want the window on top.  


* Explorer.exe might crash and restart if you spam the hotkeys too much. (Especially Show Hide taskbar key)  


* Currently TSolidBackground only works on the Primary Monitor. (for multiple monitor displays)  

If you have any problems, let me know. I'll try to fix it.
