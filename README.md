* You can change the background color using the Shift+o option window.  

* TSolidBackground.ini file will be created when you use the options key (you don't have to enter an input).  
    After creating the .ini file you can open it using a text editor to change the hotkeys too.  
    [HOTKEY EDITING GUIDE](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm)  

* If you never use the options key it will never create the .ini file so you can just carry around the .exe (or the ahk)  

* Exiting using the notification icon (right click - exit) will fix your windows if you left them in "Always On Top" mode.  
    
* Always On Top mode can be used for multiple windows at the same time  


--------------------  
**Known Bugs:**  

* Background sometimes goes over the selected window.  
-This is fixed but it might still happen on slow computers or if you don't select the window before using the hotkey.

Fix: Either Reload the program using tray menu or use the Always On Top function.  

* Keyboard language tray button disappears after using TSolidBackground function
Fix: Click anywhere in tray.  

* Explorer.exe might freeze and restart if you spam the hotkeys too much.  


If you have any problems, let me know. I'll try to fix it.
