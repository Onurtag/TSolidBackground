(Especially Show Hide taskbar key)  \r\n\r\nIf you have any other problems, open an issue. I'll try to fix it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------  \r\n##Old Updates (DD.MM.YY)  \r\n\r\n*Do not forget to generate a new TSolidBackground.ini if you are updating.*  \r\n\r\n* **Version 2.3.0:**  \r\n\r\nRemoved old options, moved to (+U)  \r\nAdded .ini option to disable startup window.  \r\nSeperated custom width and height, made new temprorary options in (+U).  \r\n\r\n* **Version 2.2.2:**  \r\n\r\nAdded custom sizing option to the .ini and did some other stuff too.\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.2.1:**  \r\n\r\nRemoved useless stuff and added useful stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.2.0:**  \r\n\r\nAdded features to Move/Resize (Shift+U)\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1.4:**  \r\n\r\nAdded window client area to resizer\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1.3:**  \r\n\r\nRemoved useless info.  \r\nNow less casual.  \r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1.2:**  \r\n\r\nAdded resize window function.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1.1:**  \r\n\r\nFixed bug when using with VNR.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1:**  \r\n\r\nTaskbar hide revamp.  \r\nAdded notes to start popup  \r\nFixed huge bugs.  \r\nNew dark color scheme.  \r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2:**  \r\n\r\nTSolidBackground revamp, now the window borders are gone too!
