{"name":"TSolidBackground","tagline":"Make any window pseudo-fullscreen using padding over window borders and background.","body":"# **TSolidBackground**  \r\n\r\nTSolidBackground allows you to immerse in a window completely by creating a solid background and hiding window borders.  \r\nIn a different saying, it tries to mimic fullscreen for any window without resizing it.  \r\n\r\nAt first I made it to better immerse in Visual Novels and later added more features that would be useful for me.\r\n\r\n    Default Hotkeys & Options (can be changed in the .ini):  \r\n    TSolidBackground hotkey: Shift+T\r\n    Always On Top: Shift+Y\r\n    Center window: Shift+G\r\n    Show/Hide taskbar: Shift+F\r\n    Advanced Ooptions: Shift+U\r\n    Suspend all other hotkeys: F8  \r\n    Default Color: 051523 (hex)\r\n\tCustom rectangle width left: 0\r\n\tCustom rectangle width right: 0\r\n\tCustom rectangle height top: 0\r\n\tCustom rectangle height bottom: 0\r\n\tEnable Startup Window: 1\r\n\r\n###[Webm Preview (v2)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onurtag/TSolidBackground/gh-pages/Preview/TSolidBackground%20Preview.webm)\r\n###[Get latest relese*](https://github.com/Onurtag/TSolidBackground/releases)  \r\n\r\n*Compiled using latest Ahk2Exe  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Current Version 2.3.0**  \r\n\r\nRemoved old options, moved to (+U)  \r\nAdded .ini option to disable startup window.  \r\nSeperated custom width and height, made new temprorary options in (+U).  \r\n\t\r\n*Do not forget to generate a new TSolidBackground.ini if you are updating.*  \r\n\r\n--------------------  \r\n## Things To Know  \r\n\r\n* You have to select the window before using most hotkeys.\r\n* You can change the background color using the Shift+O option window.\r\n* TSolidBackground.ini file will be created when you use the options key (you don't have to enter an input).\r\nAfter creating the .ini file you can open it using a text editor to change the hotkeys.  \r\n[HOTKEY EDITING GUIDE](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm)  \r\n* If you never use the options key it will never create the .ini file so you can just carry around the .exe (or the ahk)  \r\n* Always on top mode can be used for multiple windows at the same time  \r\n* Exiting using the notification icon (right click - exit) will fix your windows if you left them in always on top mode.  \r\n\r\n--------------------  \r\n**Known Bugs:**  \r\n\r\n* TSolidBackground will disable always on top if the selected window is already always on top.  \r\nYou can use the always on top hotkey afterwards if you really want the window on top.  \r\n* Hiding taskbar sometimes might not work right away, try it again.  \r\n* Explorer.exe might crash and restart if you spam the hotkeys too much. (Especially Show Hide taskbar key)  \r\n* Currently TSolidBackground only works on the Primary Monitor. (for multiple monitor displays)  \r\n\r\nIf you have any problems, let me know. I'll try to fix it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------  \r\n##Old Updates (DD.MM.YY)  \r\n\r\n*Do not forget to generate a new TSolidBackground.ini if you are updating.* \r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.2.2 (09.12.15):**  \r\n\r\nAdded custom sizing option to the .ini and did some other stuff too.\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.2.1 (11.10.15):**  \r\n\r\nRemoved useless stuff and added useful stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.2.0 (27.07.15):**  \r\n\r\nAdded features to Move/Resize (Shift+U)\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1.4 (27.07.15):**  \r\n\r\nAdded window client area to resizer\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1.3 (27.07.15):**  \r\n\r\nRemoved useless info.  \r\nNow less casual.  \r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1.2 (26.07.15):**  \r\n\r\nAdded resize window function.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1.1 (05.04.15):**  \r\n\r\nFixed bug when using with VNR.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Version 2.1 (29.03.15):**  \r\n\r\nTaskbar hide revamp.
